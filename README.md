## Installation and Setup
 - The "car_prediction_old.ipynb" file is the Jupyter notebook containing the regression data model analysis and creation from A1.
 - The "car_prediction_new.ipynb" file is the Jupyter notebook containing the Linear Regression model from scratch from A2.
 - The data folder contains the dataset used to train and test the model.
 - The app folder contains the web application that uses the trained model.
 - The website is ran on the CSIM remote server.
 - Go to st124145.ml2023.cs.ait.ac.th for the website.


## Usage
 - The home page contains a link to two prediction pages, one containing the old model from A1 (st124145.ml2023.cs.ait.ac.th/predict_old) and the new model from A2 (st124145.ml2023.cs.ait.ac.th/predict_new)
 - The prediction pages allows user input and displays the predicted results without redirecting or reloading the webpage.
